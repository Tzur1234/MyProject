# Flask Chat Application
### Video Demo: ???
### Description:

In this project I have built a simple chat app using the Flask framework, Python, Html and JavaScript. At first, I thought it would be an easy project, but the further I got with it, the more I understood the complexity of it.


Unlike the content of the CS50 course, which is really well organized and delivered, outside of that environment I found it quite overwhelming to navigate huge amounts of information about how to write a chat app using the Flask framework.
I think that the most challenging aspect was to clearly understand what I needed to learn before beginning the project. 

I learned that Socket is an object that plays a major role in communication between devices. The first thing I focused on was about sockets and how to work with them, especially how to use it with the Flask framework. Basically, every device, from smartphones to computers and servers utilizes sockets for managing the communication with other devices on the network.
To be even more accurate, each device has several programs and each of them uses sockets **to receive information and to send information** to other devices through the internet. In my case, I had to use sockets in order to manage the communication between different users (different devices, different IP addresses) sending and receiving messages in the chat app.
